# Deep-Learning-for-Multi-Day-Lake-Michigan-Rainfall-Prediction
- Designed and implemented a Hybrid deep learning model leveraging ConvLSTM and LSTM architectures to predict multi-day
rainfall events over Lake Michigan.
- Pre-processed and refined satellite imagery and meteorological data for the research project, optimizing model input through
techniques like hourly/daily slicing.
- Employed advanced methods (class weighting, sliding windows) to mitigate class imbalance and temporal dependencies within
the model, achieving a high recall rate of 0.85.
- Conducted comprehensive performance analysis of the research model, identifying areas for improvement in model generalization
and predictive capabilities
